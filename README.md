# Item Choice

Allows the player to choose a powerup of the same tier that they opened from a chest or battle totem.




### Notes

- Tested in multiplayer to some extent and NOT tested with other mods that add powerups.
- Possible ideas to be implemented.
- I'm not very experienced in Unity.

### Known Issues
- When in multiplayer, if more than one player is choosing an item, and one player chooses an item, the other players will not be able to choose an item.
- With PowerupDrop (https://muck.thunderstore.io/package/SuperGamerTron/PowerupDrop/), dropped powerups will be dropped as if a chest was opened.
