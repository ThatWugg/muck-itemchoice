# Item Choice

Allows the player to choose a powerup of the same tier that they opened from a chest or battle totem. 

### Notes

- Tested in multiplayer to some extent and NOT tested with other mods that add powerups.
- Possible ideas to be implemented.
- I'm not very experienced in Unity.

### Known Issues
- When in multiplayer, if other players are choosing an item, and another player chooses an item while the other player have the item-choosing ui open, the other players will not be able to choose an item.
- Choosing an powerup, but not actually picking an powerup, and then going to different object and choosing and picking a powerup causes the not chosen object to become the picked powerup. This is related to the issue above. tldr: there is issue with not picking a powerup.
- With PowerupDrop (https://muck.thunderstore.io/package/SuperGamerTron/PowerupDrop/), dropped powerups will be dropped as if a chest was opened.
